		<p><strong>Welcome to my personal web page!</strong>  I am currently enrolled in Greenville Technical College in the Computer Technology program.  My current career goal is to start working in an entry level capacity in Web development. While I currently have over fifteen years experience in the airline industry, I feel the time is right for me to move on and meet new challenges. I am a hands on learner and I feel that I work well under pressure, given my current job in customer service. </p>
